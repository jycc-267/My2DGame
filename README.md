## About the game
The squirrel should defeat all enemies in order to enter the next level.  
And if that level is a multiple of the number 3, one or more boss foxes will appear.  
The squirrel can attain abilities or trigger a trap by eating mushrooms.

### The logic of enemy
- The shield mushrooms and trap mushrooms are identical. Think twice before eating them.
- The slimes will chase after the squirrel.
- The foxes will teleport to another random point with random deltaX and deltaY.
- The bears move in both vertical and horizontal direction randomly and throw beehives.
- If the squirrel contacts a trap, it will become inactive until it is dead or until the current level is advanced.
